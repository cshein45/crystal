# Standard steps

The following are built-in standard steps, provided to accomplish common tasks.
Many of them are thin wrappers around an underlying step class, for example
`loadOne` and `loadMany` both call in to the underlying `LoadStep` step class. These
standard steps can be used as a foundation for your project, and are often
sufficient enough for a schema's needs - particularly when integrating with an existing
business logic layer.

## Loading data

- [loadOne][]: similar to DataLoader.load, batch loading of single values
- [loadMany][]: similar to DataLoader.load, batch loading of lists of values

## Forming objects and lists

- [list][]: takes a list of steps and turns it into a single step that resolves
  to list of the underlying steps' values
- [object][]: takes an object, the keys of which are steps, and turns it into a
  single step that resolves to an object where the values are the corresponding
  underlying steps' values
- [remapKeys][]: returns step that results in an object made up of the given renamed
  keys and values from another object step

## Operating on lists

- [first][]: returns the first entry from a list
- [last][]: returns the last entry from a list
- [reverse][]: reverses the order of a list
- [filter][]: returns only the entries in a list that satisfy a callback
- [groupBy][]: Takes a single dimensional list plan and a mapper that returns a
  grouping key. Returns a plan that results in a Map where the keys are the
  grouping keys and the values are lists of the original entries that match
  these grouping keys.
- [each][]: Transforms a list by wrapping each element in the list with the
  given mapper.

## Utility

- [constant][]: always returns the given value
- [access][]: accesses the property at the given path for each value
- [lambda][]: executes a lambda function for each set of values

<!-- TODO: not a step! -->
<!-- - [setter][]: a ModifierStep for setting given values onto a parent step -->

## Flow control

- [inhibitOnNull][]: inhibit dependent work when an input is null
- [assertNotNull][]: raise an error when a value is unexpectedly null
- [trap][]: turn inhibited or errored values back into usable data

## GraphQL

- [context][]: returns the GraphQL contextValue
- [connection][]: wraps a list-returning plan with connection-related
  capabilities such as PageInfo
- [Node-related][node]: functions relating to the GraphQL Global Object Identification spec

## Realtime

- [listen][]: Subscribes to the given `pubsubOrPlan` to get realtime updates on
  a given topic (`topicOrPlan`), mapping the resulting event via the `itemPlan`
  callback.
