# Access control

Access control is typically the responsibility of your business logic layer, as
it would be with GraphQL resolvers. The role of a [plan resolver][] is to gather
all the required details for your business logic to be able to make the
decisions on whether the user is allowed to access the data they're requesting,
and if so then what data to return.

A common approach is to authenticate the user in your HTTP layer (for example
with a session, cookie, auth token, or JWT) and then share the details of the
authentication with schema via the GraphQL context. Plan resolvers can then use
the standard [context()][context] step to extract the relevant information and
pass it through to the business logic.

[plan resolver]: ./plan-resolvers/index.mdx
[context]: ./step-library/standard-steps/context
