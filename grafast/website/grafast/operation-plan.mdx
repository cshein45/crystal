# Operation plan

:::tip

If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL terminology such as "selection set", "field",
"type" and so on, please check out our
[Operation Language](https://learn.graphile.org/docs/GraphQL_Operation_Cheatsheet.pdf)
and
[Schema Language](https://learn.graphile.org/docs/GraphQL_Schema_Language_Cheatsheet.pdf)
cheatsheets.

:::

When <Grafast /> sees an operation for the first time, it builds an _operation
plan_, which is the combination of an [**execution plan**](#execution-plan) and
an [**output plan**](#output-plan). To do so, it walks the selection sets
calling the user-provided `plan` method for each field to determine the _steps_
that need to be executed for that field. That series of steps, which we'll call
the _field plan_, is then woven with all the other field plans in the
operation, to form a directed acyclic graph we call the _execution plan_.
Whilst doing this, <Grafast /> keeps track of which fields returned which
steps, and uses this information to form the _output plan_. Finally the
_execution plan_ is optimized and finalized and the _output plan_ is finalized,
then they are ready for execution.

A simplified version of the process is this:

1. Start at the root selection set.
1. For each field in the current selection set:
   1. Call field [plan resolver][plan resolvers]
   1. Call any uncalled [argument applyPlan resolvers][]
   1. **Deduplicate** new steps
   1. Repeat step 2 using the field's selection set (if any)
1. **Tree shake**
1. **Optimise**
1. **Tree shake**
1. **Finalise**

## Execution plan

The _execution plan_ is (generally[^1]) asynchronous. It is responsible for
fetching all the data required by the operation in as efficient a manner as
possible, and can evolve quite significantly as a result of deduplication, tree
shaking and optimization.

[^1]:
    If the execution plan contains no asynchronous steps, then it can be
    executed synchronously. This is rare, though, as typically it will contain
    steps that fetch data from remote data sources such as databases or web
    services.

## Output plan

The data fetched by the execution plan will not be in any particular format,
and may have been significantly deduplicated and simplified as part of the
operations. The _output plan_ is responsible for taking this bundle of data and
formatting it back out as a valid GraphQL response, including serializing all
the leaves correctly and handling nulls and errors following the GraphQL
specification. The output plan always runs synchronously, though in streaming
situations such as GraphQL subscriptions or incremental delivery
(`@stream`/`@defer`) part of the output plan may be executed for each payload
in the underlying stream.

## Constraints

Whilst <Grafast /> is building the operation plan, it may also determined
particular constraints that govern whether the operation plan may be used for a
future request or not. For example, if the request contains
`@skip(if: $variable)` then a different operation plan would be needed depending
on whether `$variable` was `true` or `false`. Where possible, constraints are
kept as narrow as possible - for example "variable
$foo is a list" is preferred over "variable
$foo is the list [1,2,3]" - to
maximize reuse.

When an operation is seen a future time, <Grafast /> first looks for an existing
operation plan whose constraints fit the request before falling back to creating
a new operation plan.

## Lifecycle events

### Deduplicate

Once a field is fully planned, <Grafast /> will _deduplicate_ the new steps it
has produced, attempting to replace them with existing "peer" steps that already
existed. These "peer" steps will have been constructed via the same step class,
and will have the same dependencies. By deduplicating at this stage (before
planning the child selection set) we help to ensure that the schema remains in
adherence to the GraphQL specification. Deduplication can reduce the number of
steps in the plan, leading to greater efficiency (and easier to understand
plans).

### Tree shake

Once every selection set has been fully visited and every field has been
planned, the execution plan is complete.

&ZeroWidthSpace;<Grafast /> then walks through the output plans, their required steps and those
steps dependencies (and their dependencies and so on), marking them as active.
Any step that is not active is "unreachable" and thus is no longer needed,
therefore it can be be removed from the execution plan.

Certain steps are immune to tree shaking (they're seen as always active), in
particular these include certain system steps, and any step that has side
effects.

### Optimize

Once the execution plan is complete and the unnecessary steps have been tree
shaken away, <Grafast /> optimizes the plan by calling the `optimize` lifecycle
method on each step that supports it. This gives each step a chance to replace
themselves with more optimal forms by inspecting and interacting with their
ancestors.

:::info

For example if a "first" step is to optimize itself, and its parent is a "list"
step, then it can simply replace itself with the first entry in the list of
plans the "list" step contains. More advanced examples may include topics such
as joining tables in a database, or adding selection sets to a remote GraphQL
operation.

:::

The optimize method is called starting with the dependencies (leaves) and
working its way up the dependents (trunk) of the execution plan's directed
acyclic graph. Since plans should only talk to their ancestors (and not their
descendants) during optimize, this ensures that their dependencies remain what
the class expects until after it is optimized.

Once optimization is complete, <Grafast /> tree shakes again to remove any
unnecessary steps from the execution plan.

### Finalize

&ZeroWidthSpace;<Grafast /> then finalizes the plan by calling the `finalize` method on steps
that support it. This gives each step a chance to do work that need only be done
once, for example:

- a step that talks to a database might compile the SQL it needs and cache it
  for later
- a step that performs templating may build an optimized template function
- etc

### Output plan finalize

Finally, the output plans are finalized, building optimized output functions and
referencing the latest optimized steps.
