<div className={styles.intro}>

The Gra*fast* v1.0 release candidate is now available. The engine has stabilized, the
epic milestones are complete, and the runtime has been hardened by more than a year of
production use through PostGraphile V5 and standalone adopters. All that
remains is to finish the documentation and tighten the TypeScript experience.

## From working group sketches to a stable execution engine

We debuted Gra*fast* in 2020 as an answer to the limits of resolver-driven
execution. The Gra*fast* working group helped us identify four epics that had
to be solved before we could release Version 1:

- ✅ **Global dependencies**: replace global dependencies so plan resolvers can
  rely on precise, single-value inputs.
- ✅ **Early exit controls**: use flags, preventing needless downstream work
  when a branch is no longer required.
- ✅ **Plan-time evaluation removal**: eliminate `$step.eval*()` and other brittle
  shortcuts, giving us safer, more predictable execution flows.
- ✅ **Polymorphism convergence**: introduce combined steps so abstract types
  stop exploding into exponential branches.

These epics also complete the mental model we now advocate in
[“Thinking in plans”](/grafast/flow): you describe the desired dataflow once,
Gra*fast* optimizes it, and reuses that plan safely across execution requests.
With unary dependencies tidied, branching controlled, and polymorphism tamed,
it is now straightforward to reason about how values flow through the graph.

Along the way we rewrote countless plan resolvers, improved SQL generation,
refined cache behaviour, and validated the architecture inside PostGraphile V5.
The result is a planning engine that delivers holistic visibility across a
GraphQL operation while still feeling ergonomic to write against.

## What does release candidate mean for Gra*fast*?

The runtime APIs, wire protocol, and behaviour have settled but the documentation
needs to catch up, and some TypeScript types are still rough. An RC gives us
the space to focus entirely on quality before stamping the final 1.0 release.

The teams running Gra*fast* in production have shipped upgrades for months without
regressions. The project is stable enough that you should not expect further breaking
changes to runtime behaviour. However, we will continue to refine TypeScript typings
during the RC window. Most of the changes will be improvements to inference and generics,
but they may require the occasional annotation tweak in your code. TSDoc comments are
also lagging behind; treat them as a helpful hint, not a contract, until we finish the
documentation refresh.

Now is the perfect moment to validate that the “[plans as dataflow](/grafast/flow)” approach
clicks for you: do the steps Gra*fast* produce line up with the dependencies you
expect? Does the separation between execution and output plan match how you
reason about your schema? Share your feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile).

## Documentation: where we need you

The code moved faster than the words that describe it. Parts of the docs are
out of date, others are missing, and a few contradict the behaviour you see in
practice. We need review, issue reports, and small patches. Your first-hand notes
about what is unclear are invaluable.

Feedback via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/graphile/crystal) or the
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/graphile) is hugely appreciated.

## Try Gra*fast* v1 today

Install the release candidate from npm, we are keeping it under the `@beta` tag to
make transition as smooth as possible:

```bash
yarn add grafast@beta
```

If you are integrating Gra*fast* outside of PostGraphile, start with the
updated examples in the repository and let us know what still feels rough. For
PostGraphile users, this RC is the same engine that powers the V5 release
candidate, so upgrading both together is the smoothest path.

## Sponsors make Gra*fast* possible

Gra*fast* exists thanks to the companies and individuals who fund our work.
Their backing lets us spend the time needed to invent, iterate, and polish the
engine you are using today. If Gra*fast* helps you ship faster or operate more
efficiently, please consider joining them at
