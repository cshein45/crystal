<div className={styles.intro}>

Gra*fast* v1.0.0-rc.1 is now available. The engine has stabilized, the plan
epics are complete, and the runtime has been hardened by more than a year of
production use through PostGraphile V5 and standalone adopters. All that
remains is to finish the documentation and tighten the TypeScript experience.

## From working group sketches to a stable engine

We debuted Gra*fast* in 2020 as an answer to the limits of resolver-driven
execution. The Gra*fast* working group helped us identify four epics that had
to be solved before we could call v1: global dependencies, early exit
ergonomics, plan-time evaluation, and polymorphic explosion. Each of these has
landed in the past 18 months, culminating in the combined-step work shipped
this summer.

Along the way we rewrote countless plan resolvers, improved SQL generation,
refined cache behaviour, and validated the architecture inside PostGraphile V5.
The result is a planning engine that delivers holistic visibility across a
GraphQL operation while still feeling ergonomic to write against.

## Four epics complete

Each Gra*fast* epic represented a foundational rethink that had to land before
we could promise a stable 1.0:

- **Unary dependencies**: replaced global dependencies so plan resolvers can
  rely on precise, single-value inputs.
- **Early exit controls**: now use flags, preventing needless downstream work
  when a branch is no longer required.
- **Plan-time evaluation removal**: eliminated `$step.eval*()` and other brittle
  shortcuts, giving us safer, more predictable execution flows.
- **Polymorphism convergence**: introduced combined steps so abstract types
  stop exploding into exponential branches.

Those projects are now merged, shipped in production, and form the backbone of
this release candidate.

## Why call it a release candidate now?

The runtime APIs, wire protocol, and behaviour have settled. The teams running
Gra*fast* in production have shipped upgrades for months without regressions.
We also know that the documentation needs to catch up, and that some TypeScript
types are still rough. An RC gives us the space to focus entirely on quality
before stamping the final 1.0.

You should not expect further breaking changes to runtime behaviour. However,
we will continue to refine TypeScript typings during the RC window. Most of the
changes will be improvements to inference and generics, but they may require
the occasional annotation tweak in your code. TSDoc comments are also lagging
behind; treat them as a helpful hint, not a contract, until we finish the doc
refresh.

## Documentation: where we need you

- Read through the planners, step references, and tutorial content. Tell us
  where it is wrong or missing detail.
- Share recipes for multi-data-source plan resolvers so that others can learn
  from your patterns.
- Help us document the new combined-step APIs and the unary helper utilities.
- File issues when terminology disagrees with what you see in code.

Feedback via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/graphile/crystal) or the
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/graphile) is hugely appreciated. Patches
are golden, but reproducible bug reports and annotated screenshots are just as
valuable.

## Try Gra*fast* v1 today

Grab the release candidate from npm:

```bash
yarn add grafast@rc
```

If you are integrating Gra*fast* outside of PostGraphile, start with the
updated examples in the repository and let us know what still feels rough. For
PostGraphile users, this RC is the same engine that powers the V5 release
candidate, so upgrading both together is the smoothest path.

## Sponsors make Gra*fast* possible

Gra*fast* exists thanks to the companies and individuals who fund our work.
Their backing lets us spend the time needed to invent, iterate, and polish the
engine you are using today. If Gra*fast* helps you ship faster or operate more
efficiently, please consider joining them at
