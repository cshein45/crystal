## About PostGraphile V5

**Production-ready** and already powering many apps, V5 is a complete ground-up
rewrite powered by [Gra*fast*](https://grafast.org), our cutting-edge planning
and execution engine for GraphQL. It dramatically reduces Postgres load,
supports true polymorphism, and introduces incremental delivery, executable
schema exports, greater control over your schema, and much more. Its efficient
and ergonomic extensibility guides you into the pit of success. It even
introduces an “eject button” for when you feel the need to move beyond an
autogenerated schema!

V5 remains in “release candidate” during final user testing, so minor adjustments may
be needed between updates. Postgres-centric users who leverage [trusted
documents](https://benjie.dev/graphql/trusted-documents) (highly recommended!)
should experience particularly smooth sailing!

- [Intro to V5 series](https://dev.to/benjie/series/23459) on dev.to
- [V5 Documentation](/postgraphile/5)
- [V4 &rarr; V5 migration guide](/postgraphile/5/migrating-from-v4)

## Current Status

Now that all four epics are complete, the release candidate is available and
waiting for your sign-off. The runtime is ready, but the documentation and
TypeScript types still need polish. This is the final opportunity to try
PostGraphile V5 before the stable release and tell us what needs to be clearer
or smoother.

## How to help

To help us shape the final release, you can:

- Try the release candidate on your real use cases and report back
  - Ship it in production, or run it on a staging branch
  - Send feedback &mdash; **good &amp; bad** &mdash; through [GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/crystal)
    or [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile)
  - Use [benjie/ouch-my-finger](https://github.com/benjie/ouch-my-finger) to
    generate minimal reproductions
- Help address issues in the [V5 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/graphile/projects/3)
- Contribute to documentation, examples, and missing TypeScript annotations
- [Sponsor us](/sponsor) &mdash; **you rely on our software, we rely on your financial support**

## Try the release candidate today

Install the release candidate from npm, be sure to use the `@rc` tag for all
related modules:

```bash
yarn add postgraphile@rc
```

You can also try the bundled CLI without installing:

```bash
npx pgl -P pgl/amber -e -c postgres:///my_db -s public
```

Replace the connection string and schema with your own values. If you are
upgrading from V4, follow the [migration guide](/postgraphile/5/migrating-from-v4)
and let us know where it can be improved.

## Epics - COMPLETE!

With the help of the community, we identified four major issues in our new
planning engine, Gra*fast*. These issues related to ergonomics, edge cases, or
efficiency; they all required changes to user code (“plan resolvers”), so
addressing them before release was vital.

Since fixing these issues required fundamental changes to the way the system
works &mdash; re-architectures that took many months to complete &mdash; we
called them “epics”. All four are now complete, hurrah!

- ✅ Everything is batched, but “unary” values (variables, context, etc) are now treated as a special case.
- ✅ Early termination of field execution with a `null` now has first-class
  support.
- ✅ Plan-time “peeking” at runtime values is now forbidden, improving plan
  re-use (aka [remove `$step.eval*()`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/issues/2060)).
- ✅ The exponential polymorphic branching hazard is now eradicated by
  converging before branching again (achieved June 2025).
