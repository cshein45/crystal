After five and a half years of work, countless beta drops, and four Gra*fast*
epics, PostGraphile V5 has now reached **release candidate** status. This is
the last checkpoint before the final release. The runtime is ready, many of you
are already shipping it in production, and now we urgently need your feedback.
The release candidate includes some quality of life improvements, and the APIs are
stable, ready for you to try V5 today.

## Four epics, countless lessons

In February 2020 we kicked off the journey that became PostGraphile V5 and the
Gra*fast* execution engine. Since then we have shipped 38 pre-alpha, 20 alpha,
and 49 beta releases. Every stage refined the ergonomics, uncovered tricky edge
cases, and ultimately solved the four Gra*fast* epics that blocked a stable
release.

- ✅ Global dependencies are now tidy unary steps.
- ✅ Early exits are handled with flags that avoid wasted work.
- ✅ Eval is eradicated, enabling safer and simpler planning.
- ✅ Polymorphic plans now converge without exponential branching.

The result is a platform that is faster, more expressive, and easier to extend
than anything we have shipped before.

## Fresh polish in the RC

While the new features are largely locked down, the RC includes a few quality
of life improvements:

- Partitioned tables can now expose their child partitions via smart tags or a
  global option, making it easier to target specific shards in GraphQL.
- Enum table domains from V4 return, so PostgreSQL functions can accept and
  return enum-backed domain values without custom glue code.
- The simple subscriptions plugin better matches V4’s behaviour, smoothing websocket migrations.
- `@dataplan/pg` now forwards the `pg-sql2` helpers, so plan resolvers can rely
  on a single import for PostgreSQL-aware SQL building.

If you bump into rough edges while trying these changes, please raise an issue
so we can address it before the final release.

## Why this is still a release candidate

We do not anticipate more breaking changes to the runtime behaviour. Numerous
teams have already trusted beta builds in production for over a year and the
feedback has been excellent. The remaining work is polish: verifying the docs,
catching stray rough edges, and ensuring that migration guidance reflects the
software as it exists today.

You can expect the occasional breaking change in TypeScript typings as we close
gaps and simplify generics. The runtime APIs will remain compatible, but you
may need to adjust type annotations while we tighten things up. Likewise, some
TSDoc comments are behind reality; we will update them alongside the docs.

## Help us finish the documentation

The code moved faster than the words that describe it. Parts of the docs are
out of date, others are missing, and a few contradict the behaviour you see in
practice. We need review, issue reports, and small patches. Your first-hand notes
about what is unclear are invaluable.

- Walk through the guides and flag inaccuracies.
- Suggest examples that clarify tricky concepts.
- Contribute short how-tos drawn from your own migration.
- Help us verify CLI reference pages against the current defaults.

Please [open issues or pull requests](https://github.com/graphile/crystal) and
talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile). We are prioritising doc
fixes above new features during the RC period.

## Try the release candidate today

Install the release candidate from npm, we are still using the `@beta` tag to
make the transition as smooth as possible:

```bash
yarn add postgraphile@beta
```

You can also try the bundled CLI without installing:

```bash
npx pgl@beta -P pgl/amber -e -c postgres:///my_db -s public
```

Replace the connection string and schema with your own values. If you are
upgrading from V4, follow the [migration guide](/postgraphile/5/migrating-from-v4)
and let us know where it can be improved.

## Thank you, sponsors

PostGraphile is crowd-funded open-source software. The sponsors listed on
[graphile.org](https://graphile.org/sponsor) have funded the years of work that
brought us to this moment. If PostGraphile helps your team ship faster or run
leaner infrastructure, please ask your company to become a sponsor so that we
can keep investing in the project.
